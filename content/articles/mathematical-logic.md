### 1 Propositions

Propositions are statements that must be either true or false. We generally indicate propositions with the letters *P*, *Q*, *R*, and so on.

**Example**. Let *P* be "Felipe is hungry" and let *Q* be "Felipe is lazy".

#### 1.1 Connective Symbols

We can use words to form more complex statements, here's our first three connective symbols and their meaning:

| Symbols | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| &and; | and |
| &or; | or |
| &not; | not |

If *P* and *Q* stand for two statements, then we'll write *P*&and;*Q* for "*P* and *Q*," *P*&or;*Q* for "*P* or *Q*," and &not;*P* for "not *P*" or "*P* is false."

**Example**. Let *P* be "Felipe is short" and let *Q* be "Felipe is quiet". *P*&and;*Q* means "Felipe is short and quiet", *P*&and;&not;*Q* means "Felipe is short but not quiet".
