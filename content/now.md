Here’s what I’ve been up to:

- Reading ["How To Prove It"](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/how-to-prove-it/6D2965D625C6836CD4A785A2C843B3DA) by Velleman. Great way to get started with mathematics!
- Learning more about math in general. Currently studying logic and proofs but getting into discrete math and linear algebra as well.
- Using and thinking about [Lisp](/articles/lisp).
