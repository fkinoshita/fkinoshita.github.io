Most of my projects are fairly small, 
leaning more into personal computing than into industry-focused software.

## Malo

An interactive command line application to help users learn propositional logic, having the ability to set simple and complex propositions and to evaluate them using all logic operators.

You can check its <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~fkinoshita/malo#malo" target="_blank">source code here</a>.

## Wildcard

Test your regular expressions, Wildcard it's a simple application to help users learn and practice regular expressions.

On the left we have a text area we you can input the test string for the regular expression, below that there's a text input to insert the regular expression itself.

On the right there's a panel with a bunch of common regular expressions for quick reference, things like selection single characters, ranges, etc.

You can download it on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.felipekinoshita.Wildcard" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.

## Kana

Practice and learn Hiragana and Katakana, the syllabary used in the Japanese language.

It works by matching the romanized version with its correspondent Hiragana/Katakana character, each character provides a sound file for you to become familiarized with how the characters sound like as well as with how they look.

You can download it on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.felipekinoshita.Kana" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.

## Telegraph

A simple Morse code encoder and decoder.

Both text areas are synchronized, once you start typing Morse it automatically translates that into a non-Morse message in the other text area and vice versa.

You can download it on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.fkinoshita.Telegraph" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.
